# Movella Data Science: Sensor Data Analysis

## How to Use

1. Place the raw sensor data files in the `Data/` folder.
2. Run the script to clean, merge, normalize, and visualize the sensor data.
3. Review the plotted output for insights into sensor accuracy, focusing on the normalized Euler angle differences.

## Example Output

The plot displays the differences in Euler angles (X, Y, Z) between the two datasets, with normalized values in the range [0, 360]. This helps to identify any inconsistencies in sensor readings, especially during elbow movements.
